# Hi there, Hello!
## About
I am a [music producer](http://www.wolfetrax.net) who is learning javascript/web development and putting all of that learning into [my WebDevBootcamp repository.](https://github.com/cjwolfe/WebDevBootcamp)
I am also currently attending college for computer science so this is now a dumping ground for those projects when I feel like it.
